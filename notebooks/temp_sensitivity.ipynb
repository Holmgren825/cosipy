    "[Sensitivity studies using COSIPY](sensitivity_study.ipynb) is to investigate how changing the surface temperature, or any other input variable, affects the calculation of the surface mass balance. COSIPY reads the meteorological input data from a **netcdf** file during the run, i.e. during each time step the model reads the meteorological data from the corresponding time step in the input file. The input file can be either \"1D\" for a point simulation or \"2D\" for a distributed simulation. The input file can be based on either observed or modeled data.\n",

    "- Create copies of the input netcdf with different temperature biases.\n",
    "- Adapt the `NAMELIST` instances to point to the biased files. \n",
